          "answer": "Lagrangian mechanics is based on the principle of least action, finding the path that minimizes the action integral. Unlike Newtonian mechanics, it focuses on energy rather than forces, providing a more general and often simpler approach to solving mechanics problems, especially for constrained systems.",

          "answer": "Ensembles represent collections of identical systems in different possible states. The microcanonical ensemble describes isolated systems with fixed energy, volume, and number of particles. The canonical ensemble describes systems in thermal equilibrium with a heat bath at fixed temperature, volume, and number of particles. The grand canonical ensemble describes systems in equilibrium with a heat and particle reservoir, allowing for fluctuations in energy and particle number.",

          "answer": "The fundamental postulates of special relativity are: (1) the laws of physics are the same for all observers in uniform motion and (2) the speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all observers, regardless of the motion of the light source. These postulates lead to the concepts of time dilation and length contraction, altering our classical understanding of space and time as absolute quantities.",
